My alternative for Popsicle sticks built entirely in batch! lol.

Some commands:

mix - if typed during group prompt it allows you to mix up to 6 groups.

i - if typed during limit prompt it sets the limit to infinity.

rename - if typed during group prompt it allows you to rename a group directly from the program.
