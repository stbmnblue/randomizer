# randomiser
My alternative for Popsicle sticks built entirely in batch! lol.

Some commands:

mix - if typed during group prompt it allows you to mix up to 6 groups.

i - if typed during limit prompt it sets the limit to infinity.

rename - if typed during group prompt it allows you to rename a group directly from the program. To be honest, this was out of boredom. It's easier just to edit the text file.

pair - if typed during the limit prompt it will put everyone in the group you selected into pairs and store that for later reference in a text file of your choosing.
if there is an odd number of people the last pair will be a group of three. This option is compatible with the mix command.
